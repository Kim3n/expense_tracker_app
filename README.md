# expense_tracker_app

One small addition is showing total amount under the chart.

PDF of user story and file structure as well as a picture of the class diagram is located at root of project

Feedback on other students repository can be found here: https://github.com/Molnes/expense_tracker/pull/1

We also met in class to discuss class diagrams and make some comments on each others code. We mostly had the same code since we both followed the course so we didn't run into many issues and didn't need any help so we only had a few comments to give each other on this project.
